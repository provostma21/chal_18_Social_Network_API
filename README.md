# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

In this project, I wanted to create an API for a Social Network. Doing so would allow me to get practice implementing the schema/models of a database such as MongoDB. This application allows users to interact with other users at a basic level with thoughts which can then be reacted to. During this project, I learned a lot about how different models and controllers can interact with each other and combine in order to form a final product.

## Installation

Make sure to use "npm install" prior to usage. This will install any dependencies and packages from the package.json file.

## Usage

Here is a video walkthrough to assist you in navigating the API.
